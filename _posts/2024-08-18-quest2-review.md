Ever since I saw the first Oculus Rift videos playing Half-Life 2 with some Razer Hydra controller to make virtual hands for VR, it has always been my dream to one day get a hold on a VR headset to play Half-Life 2 in virtual reality, truly experiencing Gordon Freeman POV.
Now while for years it had been an elusive proposition(primarily due to the price tag), bakc in 2022 I was able to find an used Oculus(now merged into Meta) Quest 1 headset for 200 euros, and that got me through a **lot** of VR starter adventures. Now in the past some hardship times had come so I had to part with it, but ultimately I knew I'd end up picking up a Meta Quest 2 at some point. And back in the [last winter][last-winter], I was able to finally get a hold of it! So this is finally, the ***very*** late review of my personal experience with a Meta Quest 2.

## The Review

Now please note, that this review will be very opinionated in the terms of me being previously an Oculus Quest 1 used before, so there will be comparisons to that device. However, I believe the Quest 1 was a much better device in many regards, but fell short in some.

### The displays:

The displays and the lens are a **BIG** improvement over the Quest 1, hands down - the resolution improvement makes it so much less blurry in VR games(that was a big complaint for me with the Quest 1), so in shooter games and games where I need more clarity to read finer prints I don't need to squint like an old man to read the text, which is awesome!

One point where it falls short in my opinion is the finer IPD adjustment - the Quest 2 only comes with 3 IPD points, which is... *not ideal*? No, but honestly for a better iteration I get it - some corners had to be cut. With this high resolution per eye however, it is much harder to figure out the correct IPD setting to use, so now that thankfully I own a 3D printer, I had an [IPD checker][thingiverse-ipd-check] printed which showed me I need to use the 3rd IPD setting. Which begs the question - *how the hell is one supposed to go beyond?*

### Small complaint - *why* only white?

This is only a complaint from the personal standpoint, but the Quest 2(and seemingly, Quest 3) is only available in white. Now personally I don't mind white plastics, but in my experience white plastics have a tendency to go yellow over time due to UV exposure, even indirect. It would've been nice to see a black version of the headsets, but I digress.

### The bad: the headstraps

The fucking headstraps! Now these feel like the biggest downgrade and a huge price cutting measure from Meta - the fabric headstraps are a big headsore. Now sure, they are not completely useless and for light users, they *will* get the job done... but for power users and someone who wants a little more comfort, these are utter dogwater! Which ultimately necessitated me to order a Kiwico head strap, which was an awesome upgrade which not only gives proper head support with cushioning, it also has a lift-up point so it is much easier to lift up the headset to take a peek IRL. Honestly, if you want to have some serious action with the headset and are not using the Kiwico headstrap(or the limitless equivalent clones - though the Kiwico's offering is very reasonable at 40 Euros) - wyd

### Another bad: the face cushioning

Okay, this bit can be a little more nitpicky, but the rubber-like face cushioning didn't really gel with me - it just picks up sweat and presses hard into your face, which I didn't really like. Thankfully, another purchase from Kiwico later with some breathable soft fabric face cushioning and that was quickly fixed - but personally, this should have been included as standard IMO.

### The controllers

These are not a huge improvement over the original Quest Touch controllers that one receives with a Rift S or Quest 1 - except for the touch pad next to the face buttons. Honestly, for me it could just not exist there, but for those who want to disable touch input for something like VRChat(to prevent gesture blendshape control) - it is an option to use those, so can't complain.

One huge improvement IMO is the AA battery holders. Ever since I got my Xbox controller, I have been a huge advocate for batteries in controllers, and Quest controllers are no exception - in this case, they improved upon it with magnetic battery holders, which is great!
