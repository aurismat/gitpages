excerpt: <i>One utility to search them all</i>.
---

During my work and off-hours, I work with a lot of Lua modules, proprietary or open source. And while I was still learning the ropes, it would always find myself firing up a Lua interpreter and just looping through a module's functions to understand what they do.

And when one has a **lot** of Lua modules available, it can get confusing and annoying to fire up a Lua interpreter every time.
So, I solved it the easiest way I could: writing my own CLI utility!

Introducing: `luamod`! The utility which, as long as the Lua module is accessible in Lua's module search paths, it will print out all of the module's contents!

With it, instead of doing *this*(and yes, I still use Lua 5.1):
```lua
-- #$ lua
Lua 5.1.5  Copyright (C) 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio (double int64)
> a = require "string"
> for k,v in pairs(a) do print(k,v) end
sub	function: 0x5602557bf000
upper	function: 0x5602557bf060
len	function: 0x5602557bee20
gfind	function: 0x5602557bed60
rep	function: 0x5602557bef40
find	function: 0x5602557bec40
match	function: 0x5602557beee0
char	function: 0x5602557beb80
dump	function: 0x5602557bebe0
gmatch	function: 0x5602557bed60
reverse	function: 0x5602557befa0
byte	function: 0x5602557beb20
format	function: 0x5602557beca0
gsub	function: 0x5602557bedc0
lower	function: 0x5602557bee80
```

You can just do **this**!
```lua
-- #$ luamod string
sub	function: 0x5580dab50000
upper	function: 0x5580dab50060
len	function: 0x5580dab4fe20
gfind	function: 0x5580dab4fd60
rep	function: 0x5580dab4ff40
find	function: 0x5580dab4fc40
match	function: 0x5580dab4fee0
char	function: 0x5580dab4fb80
dump	function: 0x5580dab4fbe0
gmatch	function: 0x5580dab4fd60
reverse	function: 0x5580dab4ffa0
byte	function: 0x5580dab4fb20
format	function: 0x5580dab4fca0
gsub	function: 0x5580dab4fdc0
lower	function: 0x5580dab4fe80
```

This utility is available on my Gists [here](https://gist.github.com/aurismat/335a72fbc2d4211aefc6bb7a404b66e5) along with some basic instructions on how I have it set up.
