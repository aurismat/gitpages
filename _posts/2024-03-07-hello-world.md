## Hello, Internet!

Now, why on earth would a <i>noob</i> VTuber, let alone a **streamer**, would begin publishing a blog?

Very simple.
<br>
**To begin writing cool shit.**

In reality, I wanted to start writing one for years now, but now that I have recently acquired a domain, I figured there won't be any better time than now, since I won't need to rely on GitHub's subdomain BS.

Well that, and I want this blog to eventually become a logging site for anything that ends up in my brain as an idea, be it:
- Build logs for projects or whatever;
- Game/software reviews;
- `Coding` & software tip guides;
- If it ever comes to that - devlogs of any publicly-available software.

Anyway, I will do my best to put up a blog at best weekly, at worst at least monthly.

Thanks for reading this welcome blog, and I'll catch you in future posts!
