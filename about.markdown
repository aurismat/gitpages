### **I am a Lithuanian streamer & content creator in general.**
#### Also a (relative)freshman in the VTubing scene - still learning the ropes.

<br>
Originally starting in late 2020-early 2021, I have kept streaming as a hobby and enjoyed every minute of it ever since.
<br>

Interests include but are not limited to:
- Large variety of video games(included but not limited to):
  - Shooters (no Battle Royales!);
  - Racing games (both sim and arcade);
  - FromSoftware's Souls Games;
  - Stealth games(mostly Splinter Cell);
  - Sandbox games(Minecraft, Terraria, Vintage Story etc);
  - 'Mechs games(MechWarrior series);
  - OldSchool RuneScape;
- Tinkering with electronics(DIY, consumer or otherwise);
- Programming(when I have some downtime from doing that as my job);
- Sometimes, woodworking & cooking;
- Modeling in Autodesk Fusion, and texturing the models in Blender;
- **NEW!!** 3D Printing and modeling for 3D prints;
- Learning about cool stuff(like rigging models in Unity!);
- And of course, <ins>making people laugh on the Internet</ins>!
